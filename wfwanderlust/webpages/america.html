      <h2 class="head">Phoenix, Arizona:</h2>
      <p class="head">It’s a place in the Sonoran Desert. It’s extremely hot in the summer, but has LOTS to do. Some things include art walks, rock climbing expeditions, and of course; hiking!!!</p>
      <p class="head">First Friday’s is one event that happens in Phoenix. It has things such as music, art galleries, and food trucks! I recommend people check this out if they come here. It’s a great way to become a “local” at Phoenix for a night.</p>
      <p class="head">Phoenix is one of the biggest cities, so concerts are frequently happening here. In the Greater Phoenix area, there is Glendale, which has the very large State Farm Stadium, in which concerts have happened! Taylor Swift had a show there.</p>
      <p class="head">Phoenix is sometimes referred to as a group of cities. For example, there is the Greater Phoenix area, but also the Phoenix Metro Area. It can be confusing at first, but you can use the different cities depending on a person’s familiarity with the area.</p>
      <p class="head">A tip for safety: PLEASE bring a lot of water, and wear sunscreen. Phoenix will frequently be in the 100s in the summertime, so this is crucial.</p>

      <h3 class="head">Some great hotels to stay in that are affordable (including all of the Phoenix area):</h3>
      <div class="MARhotel">
        <div class="hotel1">
          <h4>The Scottsdale Plaza Resort & Villas</h4>
          <p>This amazing hotel is like a beach vacation stay, but in the desert!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hotel2">
          <h4>The Clarendon Hotel & Spa by GreenTree</h4>

      <h2 class="head">Monterey Bay, California:</h2>
      <p class="head">It’s a beautiful place with beaches right next to the Pacific Ocean. As the bay is very near to the ocean, it is an ideal temperature, but it is still a little chilly.</p>
      <p class="head">Monterey Bay is in “Monterey”, which is a town in California, but I decided to focus purely on the bay in this case.</p>
      <p class="head">There is a beautiful beach, aquariums, and an amazing university as well. (CSUMB)</p>
      <p class="head">A destination many people recommend is the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is such an amazing aquarium to visit not only due to their focus on animal conservation (such as sea otters) but also the concerns of plastic pollution. There’s a range of exhibitions frequently rotating!</p>
      <p class="head">If you are visiting Monterey Bay in the summer, and want to learn something new, try one of CSUMB’s scientific illustration classes!</p>
      <p class="head">A tip for safety: Bring sunscreen, hats, and a bag to keep your collectibles safe. Monterey Bay has somewhat of a high crime rate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="hotel2">
          <h4>Portola Hotel & Spa at Monterey Bay</h4>
          <p>With both a HOTEL and SPA, this is a place to rest and relax. It’s right next to the beach, so it's great for exploring.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hotel3">
          <h4>Monterey Tides</h4>
